    "text": "Hello! My name is Ignacio and I graduated recently as an Electronics Engineer from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María. I followed this career thinking that I would have the chance to work on observatories in Chile. Also I wanted to develop interesting DIY projects.\nTrust be told, I focused mostly on programming and data processing in my career, staying away from developing projects involving microcontrollers or analog electronics. Because of that, I wondered how amazing would be to work on my own projects with such elements.\nAlso I have a lot of ideas that constantly keep getting forgotten and keep losing the old notebooks where I wrote them down. So that’s why I chose to write this blog, to have a sort of documentation of my projects and then replicate them.\nI thank you reader for coming here and read this little extract and hope you have the best motivation to finish your own projects to your heart’s content!"

I hold a B.Sc. and Professional Degree in Electronics Engineering from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile.\nI held an internship at Paranal, where I got to know the instruments and the state of the art in astronomy! My work in there focused into protoypes and amateur electronics, which sparked the interest in me to develop projects of my own."
