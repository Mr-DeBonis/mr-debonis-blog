Hello! My name is Ignacio and I graduated recently as an Electronics Engineer from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María. I followed this career thinking that I would have the chance to work on observatories in Chile. Also I wanted to develop interesting DIY projects.

Trust be told, I focused mostly on programming and data processing in my career, staying away from developing projects involving microcontrollers or analog electronics. Because of that, I wondered how amazing would be to work on my own projects with such elements.

Also I have a lot of ideas that constantly keep getting forgotten and keep losing the old notebooks where I wrote them down. So that’s why I chose to write this blog, to have a sort of documentation of my projects and then replicate them.

I thank you reader for coming here and read this little extract and hope you have the best motivation to finish your own projects to your heart’s content!
